# Our Process

Taurus Capital has an extensive team of professionals with resources that perform all due diligence and underwriting. Generally, we can process an applicant within 7 to 14 days. The key will be the pace with which the client is able to present our underwriters with the information they require. The following is the general process we undertake to review and determine if a company is a qualified applicant for our capital partner.

1. Initial Phone call to understand your needs
2. Review Executive Summary
3. Execution of Project Summary Form
4. Upon review of the Project Summary if there is an interest in the project, you will need to provide:
    - Full Business Plan and Pro Forma
    - Bios of principals if not included in Business Plan
5. Execute Engagement Letter if there is an interest to proceed with funding
6. Once the Engagement Letter is executed:
    - Client must execute a series of intake documents prior to term sheet being provided

Upon issuance of the term sheet applicant will have 5 business days to accept or the term sheet will expire.

The entire process described above should take no more than 7 to 10 days.

> We look forward to working with seasoned entrepreneurs and experienced management teams that want to preserve the equity in their companies.
