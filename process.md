# Our Process

Taurus capital has an extensive team and resources of professionals that performs all due diligence and underwriting. Generally, we can process an applicant within 7 to 14 days. The key will be the pace and alacrity with which the client is able to present our underwriters with the information they require. The following is the general process we undertake to review and determine if a company is qualified to receive an investment offer from our capital partner.

1. Initial Phone call to understand your needs.
2. Review Executive Summary/Project Summary Form
3. After review of Executive Summary if there is an interest in project, you will need to provide:
    - Full Business Plan and Pro forma.
    - Bios of principals if not included in Business Plan.
4. Sign Engagement Letter if there is an interest to proceed with Funding.
5. Once the Engagement Letter is signed, you will need to provide:
    - Proof of funds no more than 3 days old. This amount must be 10% of the equity investment you are seeking. This reason for this will be explained on confidential phone call.
6. Once both parties have completed their due diligence, and both parties are interested in moving forward, a term sheet will be issued.
7. Upon issuance of the term sheet applicant will have 5 business days to accept or the term sheet will expire.
8. The entire process described above should take no more than 7 to 14 days.

> We look forward to working with seasoned entrepreneurs and experienced management teams that want to preserve the equity in their companies.
